            To complement my academic research with industrial perspective, I interned at Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) in the Systems Engineering department. There, I developed a risk assessment tool for safety-critical systems and applied it to Solenoid Valves, High Pressure Gas Storage, Thrust Vector Control, and Separation Systems. I also supported requirement management, safety analysis (FMEA), and architecture development throughout the launcher. Seeing how system-level decisions propagate down to components, and how component performance feeds back into architecture, gave me firsthand experience with change propagation in complex systems.
            I was also responsible for the systems reviews of ground launch systems, covering 21 systems including everything from tower umbilicals and pad water-deluge systems to fire protection, propellant handling, and storage. I reviewed P&IDs, the overall design ensuring it meets requirements, and documented every single system item, component and component type for ground launch systems.
             This role has been my most valuable professional experience, as I witnessed first-hand how systems engineering for a complex launcher and its ground infrastructure is performed.            <span style="color: #00008B;">Click on the project title for more information.</span>

            This project, as part of my research internship at the Lunar and Planetary Exploration group at TUM, involved the design and analysis of a cold plate and shroud for a thermal vacuum chamber (TVAC), aimed at replicating space-like thermal conditions for several proposed payloads to be tested. The cold plate was developed to cool down a bed of regolith simulant, while the shroud ensured effective thermal isolation. Simulations were conducted on COMSOL to evaluate the thermal performance of the setup, including heat transfer, temperature distribution, and vacuum compatibility. The study also included material selection and structural design to withstand vacuum loads and thermal cycling. This work aims to optimize the system for accurate and reliable testing of spacecraft and related components. <span style="color: #00008B;">Click on the project title for more information.</span>

            This project focused on applying topology optimization to the design of a Falcon 9 landing leg to minimize mass while maintaining sufficient stiffness. Two load cases were considered: a vertical load of 22,200 N during a soft touchdown and a shear force simulating crosswinds or sliding during landing. The optimization process achieved a mass reduction of approximately 3,656 kg, translating to significant cost savings in the aerospace industry by reducing fuel requirements. The optimized design demonstrated the potential of topology optimization in achieving lightweight, efficient, and cost-effective aerospace structures.

            This project aimed to create a demonstrater for the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) on the Moon. A collection of 3D-printed craters from the lunar poles was used, with an LED strip simulating the sun's movement and demonstrating shifting illumination patterns around the craters. The LED circuit, controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4, featured a light sensor that turned the LEDs off when not being observed. Additionally, a touchscreen interface in kiosk mode allowed users to explore Lunar data from NASA/LRO and other missions. The design included swappable craters, a sealed display case to prevent external light interference, and a reliable power supply for extended operation, making it an effective tool for visualizing and understanding lunar PSRs.

            This project, developed as part of a competition in which we won first place, focused on designing a controlled test-bed facility that simulates Martian environmental conditions to support diverse experiments. The facility includes three isolated compartments to test varying soil types, atmosphere compositions, and other factors critical for Mars-like conditions. Key parameters such as pressure, temperature, and atmospheric composition can be modified, while Martian soil is replicated using regolith simulants. Potential applications include testing the growth of edible plants under harsh conditions, evaluating genetically modified crops, and assessing energy requirements for sustaining life. Although limitations exist, such as accurately replicating Martian soil and radiation exposure, the facility aims to advance research on life support systems, soil fertility, and environmental control technologies for future Mars exploration.

          <h4>Air-breathing Electrostatic Thruster (February 2023 to June 2023) <i class="fa fa-flask"></i></h4>
            This project focused on designing and testing air-breathing electrostatic thrusters for high-altitude applications, offering a propellant-free alternative to traditional ionic propulsion. Two multi-stage thruster designs were developed using copper wire grids as emitters and aluminum plates as collectors, significantly reducing ozone generation compared to needle-based designs. Tests explored optimal emitter-collector spacing, orientation, and stage configurations, revealing that parallel alignment and additional stages improved efficiency, though with diminishing returns due to airflow obstruction. Ground and microgravity tests, including parabolic flight experiments, validated the thrusters' performance, demonstrating their potential for clean, cost-effective propulsion in low-demand maneuvers like attitude control and station-keeping.

            A Numerical Simulation of Non-Circular Channels and Nozzles. This project built upon prior research indicating that tri-arc-shaped channels outperform other geometries in enhancing the performance of rotating detonation engines. A detailed analysis of flow within rotating detonation engines was conducted, examining eight distinct non-circular channel geometries. The detonation phenomena were simulated using Converge CFD, while flow behavior was analyzed with Ansys CFX. The results demonstrated that tri-arc-shaped engine channels offer superior stability for rotating detonation waves, providing valuable insights for advancing engine efficiency and performance.

            This project explored the application of Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) to carbon emission price forecasting, a novel approach in this field. A historical dataset of carbon emission prices, spanning over 12 years with 3,071 entries, was analyzed to identify variations in the fractal structure of the signal. The dataset was also processed through a neural network to forecast spot and futures prices. MFDFA was applied to the error signal of the neural network to assess the accuracy of predictions. The analysis yielded promising results, with an average root-mean-square error of 0.660 during training and 0.771 during prediction. Further, trimming the error signal reduced variance by 68.8%, demonstrating the potential of combining MFDFA and neural networks for improving accuracy in carbon emission price forecasting. This research highlights a significant step toward innovative methods in environmental and economic analysis.

            This project, organized by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, involved designing and building a fully mechanically operated vehicle, with no control system, capable of moving in a straight line, reversing, and attempting to stop precisely at its origin. The vehicle utilized a rack-and-pinion system with a gearbox to measure distance, a laser-cut acrylic chassis for cost-effectiveness, and a DPDT switch to reverse motor polarity. The design was successfully presented, with the prototype completing two out of three competition runs.

            This project involved designing and prototyping a movable bridge to allow the passage of boats or barges. A bascule bridge design was selected and fully modeled in Fusion 360, with plans for laser-cut wooden prototypes. Inspired by the Arlington Memorial Bridge, the design was successfully presented, earning excellent grades. However, prototype manufacturing was halted due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

              This project marked my first hands-on experience during my bachelor progem, focusing on the design and construction of a functional flying vehicle. Using AutoCAD and Fusion 360, the chassis was  designed, laser-cut, and assembled. The electronic circuit was developed on TinkerCAD, and control code was written in Python. The project culminated in a successful demonstration, showcasing the vehicle's capabilities during testing.
